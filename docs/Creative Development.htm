          <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="3">Creativity is now recognised as the
            key ingredient, not only of the successful artist, but also of the
            successful chief executive and organisation. The Arts Clinic has devised
            a unique method of working, It comprises a powerful blend of psychological
            techniques and philosophical insights, combined with a specialist
            knowledge of individual and organisational creativity.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CCCCCC"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Utah'><font size="3">We link the practical with the imaginative for
            constructive solutions and original initiatives. This will enable
            an individual to manifest their full potential, from concept through
            implementation to result.</font></span></font></p>

          <p><font color="#CCCCCC"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Utah'><font size="3">An opportunity for middle to high-level executives
            in the creative industries to improve their performance through a
            programme of one-to-one sessions.</font></span></font></p>
          <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="3">Creativity is essential for every
            aspect of individual and organisational life. In the business environment
            this understanding aims to develop confident handling of work and
            personal relationships, inspirational leadership, the ability to define
            and implement clear goals and to continually generate fresh vision.
            It can be applied to such issues as the initiation of internal organisational
            change, the negotiation of imposed, external change, the management
            of a career re-orientation, or the successful induction into a new
            organisational position. It can also help put it right when things
            go wrong. It is often lonely on the way up and can be even lonelier
            at the top and frightening to feel the downward fall. Mentoring offers
            a safe place to explore the personal and the professional.</font></p>

font-family:Utah'><font size="3">A programme of one-to-one support which allows
            the artist to foster their individual creativity and long-term creative

font-family:Utah'><font size="3">Difficulties in harnessing creative energy may
            surface in many ways ; such as creative block, burn out or anxiety.
            The Creative Development programme gives the artist a full understanding
            of the creative process and their own unique ways of fully expressing
            creativity. It also deals with the application of creativity in real
            terms to a particular project &ndash; for example, an album, performance,
            career transition or writing project.<br>

font-family:Utah'><font size="3">The pressures of celebrity are a unique feature
            of this age. It is virtually impossible to be a success nowadays
            without the accompanying fame. There is nothing that prepares someone
            for the impact of celebrity, not only on their own lives but also
            on personal and working relationships.</font></span></font></p>
          <p><font color="#CCCCCC"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Utah'><font size="3">Maintaining a sense of identity is often an extremely
            difficult negotiation. It entails dealing with public acclaim or
            censure, acquiring fame or losing it., along with defining and maintaining
            an awareness of self.</font></span></font></p>
          <p><font color="#CCCCCC"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

            self that is strong enough to be able to distinguish between the powerful
            projections of others and what is real and meaningful to their own
            identity and creative development.</font></span></font></p>
